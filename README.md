# the-green-chair-project

Please see final.pdf for STATCOM's analyses of The Green Chair Project's client demographics in Wake County. This report contains an exploration and analysis of data on The Green Chair Project's (TGCP) clients and Wake County public schools through plots and maps.

Some of the analyses include choropleths (using R package choroplethrZip), merging CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) census tract data with the client zip codes, and a collection of useful, longitudinal data provided by the Wake County Public School System. 

Note: All of the client data was removed with BFG Repo-Cleaner.
