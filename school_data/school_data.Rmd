We were able to find a variety of useful, longitudinal data provided by the Wake County Public School System.
While our analysis mainly focused on using Free and Reduced-Price Lunch Program information (as a proxy for economic status), we wanted to provide these additional resources in case they are useful to you now or in the future.


To start, [**here you can find**](https://www.wcpss.net/domain/100) a summary of the current status of the WCPSS.
This includes number of schools, employees, number of students on the Free and Reduced-Price Lunch Program, and more.
Additionally, they provide a _Reports by year_ section.
This breaks the information out at the school level.
This is where we obtained the Free and Reduced-Price Lunch Program data for each school.
They also offer ethnicity breakdowns, limited English proficiency rates, and special education services.
[**You can view the spreadsheet for the 2020-2021 school year here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q7_HttWQBxRJfEGsvVl6Xf8slbLqxvuQvJ9Fz3hcL4k/edit#gid=1941273913), with previous years available on their website.


We also found a variety of information from [**the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NC DPI)**](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools).
Some variables include [**cohort graduation rate, ACT results, and SAT and AP results**](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools/testing-and-school-accountability/school-accountability-and-reporting).
These data are again broken up by school and include other school districts along with Wake County.
These were not the focus of our analysis, as there are often biases in these scores; however we wanted to provide the resource in you find other uses for it.
NC DPI also provides [**discipline and dropout data**](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/data-reports/dropout-and-discipline-data/discipline-alp-and-dropout-annual-reports#2018-19).
This includes tables about crime, dropout rates and counts, and suspensions.
We found this data to be mostly prevalent to high schools and less so in elementary and middle schools.

[**Finally, here is a nice visualization about postsecondary enrollment in North Carolina high schools.**](https://www.nccommunitycolleges.edu/analytics/dashboards/postsecondary-enrollment-high-school)
It allows options to change charts to look at breakdowns for particular schools.
Since this data was also focused exclusively on high schools, we did not make use of it ourselves.
