            <abstract>This dataset is an updated version of the 2008 dataset containing all public school locations in North Carolina. New schools were geocoded in ArcGIS 10 and merged with the existing dataset. Closed schools were removed,and existing attribute information was updated with current data. Some new fields were added, including designations for Pre-K, Elementary, Middle, High, and Early College schools. A review process was performed to move incorrect existing school points to new correct locations. Not all points were able to be individually reviewed,and may represent approximate school locations. This update was a collaborative effort among the Center for Geographic Information and Analysis, Institute for Transportation Research and Education, and NC Department of Public Instruction. Current school data was provided by NC DPI, using the Educational Directory and Demographical Information Exchange (EDDIE), found at http://apps.schools.nc.gov/eddie. ITRE used this dataset to conduct the update process, which included all steps of GIS analysis listed above. CGIA consulted on processing steps, lineage, and quality control to prepare the dataset for the NC OneMap Geospatial Portal.</abstract>
            <purpose>This data was created to assist governmental agencies and others in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic Information System (GIS).</purpose>
            <supplinf>The description for the 2008 published datasets was as follows. CGIA developed this set of point locations for public schools in North Carolina as part of a project for the NC Division of Emergency Management. School data serves multiple purposes, but foremost for this project, public schools are vital facilities in terms of emergency management. Many schools serve as shelters and all are critical to hazard vulnerability planning and emergency response. CGIA used two methods to generate point locations for public schools. First, CGIA used a road network from GDT, Inc. with ArcView GIS to geocode the addresses. The initial process matched 60 percent of the schools with a point on the road network. Point locations are approximate, based on an interpolation of street numbers along street segments. Second, CGIA worked with the NC Department of Public Instruction to use the Transportation Information Management System (TIMS) to determine school locations. Many of these pointlocations are coincident with the center of school buildings on digital imagery or along driveways and may be more accurate than points located using the first method.

                <horizpar>New school points were generated using geocoding in ArcGIS 10. All unmatched points were interactively matched using 2010 NC OneMap Orthoimagery, Google Maps, and/or individual school websites. Point locations for about half of existing schools were reviewed and moved if necessary. This was done using a layer of geocoded points from the current EDDIE data as reference. The geocode produced 82% matched addresses. A distance was calculated from the existing school points to the geocoded reference points to determine which existing points were most likely to require editing. 1115 of the 2594 points were reviewed and of those, 407 were moved from an incorrect to a correct location.</horizpar>

            <procstep>
                <procdesc>Three main steps were involved in the update process: (1)Updating the dataset to reflect schools that have been added and closed, (2)Updating the attributes of all schools with the most current data, and (3)Performing quality control for existing school locations. Step(1) The most current school data was obtained through NCDPI's Educational Directory and Demographical Information Exchange (EDDIE) at http://apps.schools.nc.gov/eddie. In ArcMap, comparisons were made between the new and old data using the 6-digit school number to determine which schools had since been added and closed. The new schools were geocoded and all unmatched addresses were interactively matched using 2010 NC OneMap Orthoimagery, Google Maps, and/or individual school websites. The new school points were merged with the existing dataset and all closed schools were deleted. Step(2) The table from EDDIE with current school data was joined to the dataset to update attributes. Fields containing potentially outdated information were populated with current data from EDDIE. Several new fields were added to enhance the usability of the dataset. These include: SCH_DESIGNATION, SCH_CTYPE, EXT_HOURS, PRE_K, ELEM, MIDDLE, HIGH, EARLY_COLL, and COUNTY. Step(3) Point locations for already-existing schools were reviewed and moved to the correct location if necessary. In order to locate incorrect points more efficiently, a geocode was performed for all schools using the up-to-date addresses from EDDIE. An initial 82% match was generated, but no further interactive matching was performed since the the geocode was simply being used as a reference. A distance was then calculated from each existing school point to the nearest newly-geocoded point. Larger distances indicated schools whose geocoded point was either far away or unmatched. In both cases, larger distances correlated with incorrect existing school locations. All points with a distance over 1000 feet were reviewed and moved if necessary. As time allowed, smaller distances were reviewed. For incorrect school locations, the newly-geocoded points provided the correct location in about half of the cases. These references were made against the 2010 NC OneMap Orthoimagery. Google Maps and individual school websites were also used to find the correct locations for incorrectly-placed schools. Using this method, 1115 of the 2594 schools were reviewed and of those, 407 points were moved.</procdesc>
