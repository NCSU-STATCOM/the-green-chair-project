Instructions to access the RStudio container with all the code, data, and installed packages necessary for mapping:



First, install Docker Desktop on your computer using instructions at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

When Docker is installed and working correctly you should be able to run the Docker hello world image by typing in your terminal `docker run hello-world`



Second, you can run the image asheng1067/mapping by the terminal command `docker run -e PASSWORD=tgcp --rm -p 8787:8787 asheng1067/mapping` 



Then, to access the RStudio on the web browser:

1) Open a web browser
2) There are multiple ways to find the correct address for the RStudio instance:
	i) Enter `http://`, followed by your ip address, followed by `:8787`. 
	ii) If you are running a Linux machine, you can use localhost as the ip address: `http://localhost:8787`.  
	iii) On Docker Desktop, click on the container, then click on "Open In Browser".  



You should now have access to the RStudio instance. To exit out of the container, do ctrl-C. However, this will reset all edits and erase all files generated by the RStudio instance, so make sure to download plots and other files before exiting.
